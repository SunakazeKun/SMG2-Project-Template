* Authors: Aurum

* Parameters: See other MorphItemNeo and MorphItemCollection objects
* 
* Two Power-ups from SMG1, the Ice Flower and Flying Star, did not make an appearance in SMG2 for unknown reasons.
* Luckily enough, all of their transformations still remain in the game. Only the models and the collectible Power-up
* items have to added back to the game. It appears that the developers attempted to delete some of the Flying Star's
* functionality since wall jumping and pulling coins does not work anymore.
* 
* Both Power-ups have unused effects for appearing, however. The Power-ups now use their respective effects as
* originally intended.
